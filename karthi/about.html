								<h3>What does SWIFT do?</h3>
								<p>Our focus is to increase womens participation in learning, sharing and contributing to the Free Software communities..</p>
								<h3>Why SWIFT?</h3>
								<p>SWIFT was started to increase the women contribution towards free software and technologies. They started it because of the need of women contrbution.</p>
								<h3> Here rises the question why we need women contribution? </h3>
								<p> It's because to share their views and ideas, to reduce women discrimination, to avoid inconvinence because of more male participants in any event, 
								to show what they are capable of and to expose themselves better towards free software.</p>
								<h3>Then comes the question Is women contribution less and why is it less? </h3>
								<p>omen contribution less and why is it less? 
                            Ofcourse it is less( but now it is gradually increasing). Women contribution is less because of many factors like Education, Society & Culture, Male Chauvinism, Lack of Awareness, less eagerness, etc..</br>
	      As a result of this FSFTN started its activity towards improving the women contribution.</p>
								<h3> Origin of SWIFT :</h3>
								<p>  It was started as an activity of FSFTN to maxmize the women contribution towards free software in 2002. By then there was no initiative as separate sub-system of FSFTN. Later the First step towards SWIFT Initiative started on Dec 27th, 2014 with 20 women participants.</br> Till SWIFT activities are continuing and we will contribute even more..</p>
